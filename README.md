Video compression using ffmpeg
Originally meant for a video uploading service for my site, but it was too taxing and kept crashing the server. Might revive some day when I get a super computer server.
Compressed videos are stored in the temp folder

requirements (probably works with many versions, It's just what I'm using): 
node.js v18.16.0
npm 9.6.5
ffmpeg 6.0 

todo:
- clean up "tmp" files from temp folder
- progress bar
- ffmpeg options
